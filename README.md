# NLP-Email-Spam
 The NLP Email Spam Classification project focuses on using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify emails as either spam or legitimate (ham). Spam emails are a prevalent issue, and this project demonstrates how machine learning can be employed to automatically identify and filter out spam emails, improving users' email experience.
